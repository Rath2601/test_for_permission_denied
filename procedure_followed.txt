!! ERROR !!

remote: Permission to Rath2601/spring-core.git denied to Raj-Naveen.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/Rath2601/spring-core.git/':
The requested URL returned error: 403


!! PROCEDURE !!

First tried and used the Personal Access Token 
But I need to use every time I push the code.

Second I've deleted the credential in (Control Panel\User Accounts\Credential Manager) of Github for Visual Code , github.com and git (some kind of github related credentials).

After deleting them I can able to link local <--> remote repo using git remote ad origin <URL of git repo created>. Need to check again by commiting this file.
