!! ERROR !!

remote: Permission to Rath2601/spring-core.git denied to Raj-Naveen.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/Rath2601/spring-core.git/':
The requested URL returned error: 403


!! PROCEDURE !!

First tried and used the Personal Access Token 
But I need to use every time I push the code.

Second I've deleted the credential in (Control Panel\User Accounts\Credential Manager) of Github for Visual Code , github.com and git (some kind of github related credentials).

After deleting them I can able to link local <--> remote repo using git remote  add origin <URL of git repo created>. Need to check again by commiting this file.

!! NOTE !! 

can able to push to the remote easily by just the command 'git push'. Need to check with test repo again for final confirmation
